# Autonomous Driving System

## 📌 Introduction

Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, leverage a combination of **sensors**, **cameras**, **radar**, and **artificial intelligence** to navigate and drive without human input. These systems are designed to:

- Reduce accidents caused by human error  
- Improve overall traffic flow  
- Provide mobility for individuals unable to drive  

Companies such as **Waymo**, **Tesla**, and **Cruise** are pioneers in this space, conducting large-scale testing on public roads. Despite substantial advancements, widespread deployment still faces hurdles including:

- Safety regulations  
- Public trust and acceptance  
- Technological and environmental limitations
